            My first robot was a Lego Mindstorms EV3 I got when I was 13, and I still remember
            spending many hours getting it to follow a flashlight in my room.
            That interest went quiet for a while. I started out studying
            Digital Business Management, until a data science and machine
            learning course during Covid pulled me back in. I realized I am more interested
            in mathematics and programming than business, and wanted a proper
            foundation to build on. Therefore, I started over with a second bachelor in
            computer science at TU Darmstadt.

            Since then I&apos;ve focused on machine learning, both in my studies and
            as a working student, most recently at Compredict, building ML and
            data engineering tools, and before that at BioNTech and Fresenius. I
            think that &quot;embodied AI&quot; (robots) is the next big step after the current LLM wave.
            Therefore, that&apos;s the direction I want
            to keep pushing, currently by exploring Imitation Learning and VLAs.
            Away from the screen you&apos;ll usually find me in the gym or on my bike.
